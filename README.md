# CMPG-323-34962913-Project3
This Readme will be used to describe project 3 and it's functionality.

The brancging strategy used: I cloned the repo onto my computer and worked on the main/master branch and commited the changes using github desktop.

This repo was not created 7 days ago, I had to create a new one and refork the original repo because I ran into an error that I could not fix for the longest time.
