# CMPG-323-34962913-Project3
This Readme will be used to describe project 3 and it's functionality.

The brancging strategy used: I cloned the repo onto my computer and worked on the main/master branch and commited the changes using github desktop.

This repo was not created 7 days ago, I had to create a new one and refork the original repo because I ran into an error that I could not fix for the longest time.

The Home page will include the Zones, Categories, Devices and Logout. Users can be registered and login.
Zones, Devices and Categories can be managed, thus added, deleted and or edited.
